Fork of - https://github.com/rpetrich/deciduous/tree/master

A web app that simplifies building attack decision trees as described in the Security Chaos Engineering report.

Hosted at - https://shannaniggans.github.io/mitre-attack-tree/

The idea if to modify the 'Deciduous app' to be focused on MITRE ATT&CK scenarions, tactics, techniques, goals and mitigations and draw the links. This is early days.

What we are planning on doing:
* Changing the node weight to be: Reality > Facts (MITRE tactics) > attacks > goals > mitigations
* when you click a node, the chain will be filetered in view

How to use.
1. The left hand text pane is where you add or edit your YAML, for now there is a large ransomware YAML (not complete) but its good to play witht he features.
2. The filter function at the end is VERY useful

I'll update this more ;)
